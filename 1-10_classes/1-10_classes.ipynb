    "Python is what's known as an **Object-Oriented** language. When we work with Python code, we deal with structures meant to usefully describe our data with characteristics and capabilities that make data easier to reason about.\n",

    "Computers don't know anything. At the very base, a computer is only good at detecting the presence or absence of electicity. Everything else is just layers of abstraction above that. But that's not how people think about the universe, and modern programming languages have concepts that seek to more closely align computer mechanics with human thought. That's what objects are.\n",

    "Classes are incredibly useful for structuring data, but making them takes some getting used to."
